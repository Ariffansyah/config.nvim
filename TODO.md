# TODO

This is just my personal note to improve this Neovim Configurations, don't mind me.

- [ ] Display full path instead of file name on Harpoon buffers.
- [ ] Refining some keybinds to its optimal usage.
- [ ] Fixing edgy window working as intended but not the one I expected (Opening files in edgy window stretches it, instead of taking space beside it)
- [ ] Fixing the terminal to be able to open in the same window as the current buffer.
- [x] Adding image preview in neo-tree (ImageMagick backend).
- [ ] Will probably moving Harpoon Buffers to Bufferline/Lualine/Heirline.
